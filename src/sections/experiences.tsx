          I contribute to building workplace productivity and fostering
          connections through the Viva Engage platform, leveraging modern
          front-end technologies such as TypeScript, React, and Webpack. I
          author technical specifications and lead projects that bring clarity
          and direction to cross-team initiatives.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a member of a platform team, I focus on improving performance,
          ensuring accessibility, and enhancing the developer experience through
          the development and maintenance of a comprehensive design system
          library. I have led internationalization efforts to make our product
          accessible to global audiences, and I’ve driven the creation of new,
          reusable features designed for adoption across multiple feature crews.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also design and implement seamless integrations between Viva Engage
          and other Microsoft 365 services, including SharePoint, Outlook, and
          Teams. I work closely with product managers and designers in a
          collaborative, interdisciplinary environment to deliver intuitive,
          engaging, and user-centered UI/UX experiences.

        <p>
          At QuintoAndar I worked as a Software Engineer on mission-driven
          projects that challenged me daily and accelerated my technical growth.
          I strengthened my JavaScript and React expertise while contributing to
          and maintaining our internal system design libraries. I authored and
          maintained tests using Jest and gained hands-on exposure to software
          architecture and scalable design patterns.
        </p>

        <p>
          I partnered closely with Product Owners, Designers, and fellow
          engineers in a collaborative, cross-functional environment to deliver
          features that materially improved the internal Operations experience —
          helping increase lead conversion and expand company revenue. My team
          prioritized knowledge sharing through regular Tech Talks, and I both
          presented and learned from peers to raise the team’s technical bar.
        </p>

        <p>
          Given broad ownership to propose and lead initiatives, I drove
          improvements to our engineering guidelines and best practices. I was
          also actively involved with other female engineers in gender-equality
          initiatives, helping create a more inclusive workplace.

        <p>
          At PRORADIS, I have helped build multi-platform mobile applications
          with Flutter and Dart. I also had the opportunity to learn C# along
          the way and have my first experience with back-end applications.

          Since the company was on the Medicine field, the project I worked in
          focused on making patients reports available online through our
          platform. Basically, we intermediated the process of a Doctor writing
          uploading patient's reports - alongside pictures and any related files
          - online and making it available for download.

          During my time in Vitrio, I had the chance to work with the e-commerce
          platform VTEX and help clients increase their sales with high
          performing pages. I also got to learn about Google Analytics and how
          to gather customer data in order to deliver a highly customized
          experience during further access.

          My experience working in Epico has taught me a lot about teamwork and
          coding best practices. I had the opportunity to work with highly
          skilled developers that guided me all the way.
        </p>

        <p>
          I used a lot of the CSS Framework Bootstrap and the preprocessor Sass,
          as well as PHP with Laravel. I had to learn how to look through the
          documentation of each technology to understand all their
          possibilities.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another very important thing I learned was how to use Javascript
          frameworks. It was the first time I ever heard of Angular and VueJS,
          that became everyday tools to me.

          I have participated in the company as an intern, but as soon as I
          finished college, I was hired. At D1UP we build websites to promote
          either our client's business or a punctual action.

          I got to learn a lot about CSS properties and best practices and
          Semantic HTML.

          Working with a multidisciplinary team has made me understand how to

          Designers to deliver the best product to the end-user.
